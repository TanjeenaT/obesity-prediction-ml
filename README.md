# Obesity Level Prediction Using Machine Learning
Obesity levels prediction based on lifestyle and demographic factors using classical ML models and neural network.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict obesity levels based on lifestyle habits, dietary patterns, and physical activity. The dataset contains 2,111 records collected from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, covering features related to eating habits, physical condition, and health indicators. The target variable classifies obesity levels ranging from underweight to different obesity categories.

The project follows a complete machine learning workflow:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature selection
4. Classical machine learning modeling
5. Neural network modeling
6. Model evaluation and comparison
